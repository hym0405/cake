# Homemade Serapure beads

The goal here is to create a substitute for AMPure XP that is of equal effectiveness in comparison to the commercial product but far more cost‐effective ($19/mL versus $0.46/mL). The beads can also be used for RNA extraction (Confirmed in YH’s RNA-seq experiment). The protocol is adapted from https://ethanomics.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/serapure_v2-2.pdf

## Materials

* Sera‐mag SpeedBeads (Fisher # 09‐981‐123)
* PEG-8000
* NaCl
* 0.5M EDTA, pH 7.5 (use freshly opened bottle for RNA-level beads)
* 1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (use freshly opened bottle for RNA-level beads)
* Tween 20
* 2% E-gel
* E-gel 1kb+ ladder
* Nuclease-free or Ultrapure water (use freshly opened bottle for RNA-level beads)

## Steps

1. In a 50 mL conical using sterile stock solutions, prepare TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA = 500 µL 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 + 100 µL 0.5 M EDTA, fill conical to 50 mL mark with dH2O).

2. Mix Sera-mag SpeedBeads well by vigorous vortex and transfer 350uL to a 1.5 mL Lo-Bind DNA tube.

3. Place SpeedBeads on magnet stand until all beads are drawn to magnet (you could put the tube on PCR-tube rack and put a small strong magnet iron next to it).

4. Remove supernatant with P1000 and P200 pipette (use P1000 first and use P200 to remove the last drop).

5. Add 0.5 mL TE to beads, remove from magnet, mix, return to magnet.

6. Remove supernatant with P1000 and P200 pipette (use P1000 first and use P200 to remove the last drop).

7. Add 0.5 mL TE to beads, remove from magnet, mix, return to magnet.

8. Remove supernatant with P1000 and P200 pipette (use P1000 first and use P200 to remove the last drop).

9. Add 0.5 mL TE to beads and remove from magnet.  Fully resuspend and set tube in rack (i.e. not on magnet stand).

10. Add 9 g PEG-8000 to a new 50 mL, sterile conical.

11. Add 10 mL 5 M NaCl to conical.

12. Add 500 µL 1 M Tris-HCL to conical.

13. Add 100 µL 0.5 M EDTA to conical.

14. Fill conical to ~ 49 mL using sterile ddH2O.  You can do this by eye, just go slowly.
15. Mix conical for about 3-5 minutes until PEG goes into solution (solution, upon sitting, should be clear).

16. Add 27.5 uL Tween 20 to conical and mix gently (pipette use P200 extremely slowly).

17. Add 0.5 mL SpeedBead (in TE solution) to conical.

18. Fill conical to 50 mL mark with ddH2O (if not already there) and gently mix 50 mL conical until brown.
