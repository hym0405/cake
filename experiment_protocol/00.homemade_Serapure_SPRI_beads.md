# Homemade Serapure beads

The goal here is to create a substitute for AMPure XP that is of equal effectiveness in comparison to the commercial product but far more cost‐effective ($19/mL versus $0.46/mL). The beads can also be used for RNA extraction (Confirmed in YH’s RNA-seq experiment). The protocol is adapted from https://ethanomics.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/serapure_v2-2.pdf
